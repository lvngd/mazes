Generating and solving mazes in Python(version 3.6.5)

There is a corresponding [blog post](https://lvngd.com/blog/generating-and-solving-mazes-with-python/) for this project.

```
python run.py
```

This will generate similar visualizations to the ones found in the blog post, and they can be found in the `animations` directory. The maze is randomly generated, which is why it won't look exactly the same.

I think this will be an ongoing project because I want to visualize some other mazes as well, and add more algorithms to solve them with.

Right now there is one maze generator that uses Kruskal's algorithm, and solvers using breadth-first search, depth-first search with backtracking, and Dijkstra's algorithm.
